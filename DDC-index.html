   <h2>Why choose to stay with us you ask?</h2> 
    <h3>There are many things to consider when choosing a company that will take care of your dog and all their needs. Trust is a critical factor that should be at the top of every pet parent’s mind. At Lucky Pet Lodge, you can rest assured that when your dog is with us, they are in safe and loving hands. Providing peace of mind for those times you can’t be with your pup is our number-one priority.</h3>
   <h2>What Sets Us Apart from the Rest</h2>
   <h3>Your dog deserves the best – they deserve the premier, all-inclusive services of Lucky Dog Pet Lodge. Here, your pup can romp and play all day long, socializing with other dogs and humans. It’s no wonder pups pull their parents to our front door every time they come to Camp!</h3>
   <ul>
     <li>Regular exercise to maintain a healthy weight</li>
     <li>Relief from boredom, separation anxiety, and destructive behaviors</li>
     <li>Improved socialization with people and other dogs</li>
